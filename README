This is a trivial Racket program which will plot central England
temperature records from the Met Office.  It's just playing: it was
initially a gist but has now got a bit bigger.  You can also plot
temperatures averaged over a 'decade' where a 'decade' is in fact
configurable, as well as a decaing average temperature with a
configurable decay.  Finally you can plot monthly average temperatures
in 3d.

The decadal and decaying algorithms may be questionable or wrong: I
wrote them quickly and without thinking very hard.

It looks to me as if some of the late-17th-century averages in the
data are wrong, but I may be misunderstanding them.

There is now also an attempt at computing and plotting the growing
season changes, using MO daily temperature data.  This is a lot less
thought-about than the abovve code.
