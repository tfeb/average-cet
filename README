This is a trivial Racket program which will plot central England
temperature records from the Met Office.  It's just playing: it was
initially a gist but has now got a bit bigger.  You can also plot
temperatures averaged over a 'decade' where a 'decade' is in fact
configurable.

It looks to me as if some of the late-17th-century averages in the
data are wrong, but I may be misunderstanding them.
