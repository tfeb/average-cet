This is a trivial Racket program which will plot central England
temperature records from the Met Office.  It's just playing: it was
initially a gist but has now got a bit bigger.  You can also plot
temperatures averaged over a 'decade' where a 'decade' is in fact
configurable, as well as a decaing average temperature with a
configurable decay.  Finally you can plot monthly average temperatures
in 3d.

The decadal and decaying algorithms may be questionable or wrong: I
wrote them quickly and without thinking very hard.

It looks to me as if some of the late-17th-century averages in the
data are wrong, but I may be misunderstanding them.

There is now also an attempt at computing and plotting the growing
season changes, using MO daily temperature data.  This is a lot less
thought-about than the above code.

As of sometime in 2022 the Met Office has changed the format
(and location) of this data.  This code has been changed to know the
new locations and (in the case of the daily data) to use the new,
better format.  I haven't extensively tested this.
